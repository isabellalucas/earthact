I meant to create a visually simple site but with imediate impact for the user by making their full visual and auditory attention focused on the main element. 
The video of the Earth in rotation seen from space allow us to have a unique perspective of the planet as a live organism and as whole. The video emphasizes the Earth at night and we can see the artificial lights from space, the main indication of our "infestation" down here.
The sound effects were meant to make the impression of that's what Earth sounds like if we could hear it from space. And we can hear four phases of the sound representing the devastation we made. First, the sound emmited is the pure sound of nature, the natural state. Following, a deafening sound of human noise and city traffic representing the destruction we are doing. Third, the fire that can consume everything in our future. Last, the silence of the extinction.
The words appearing on the screen are a calling for act and the constant awareness state that we have to be on in order to save whats left of our planet and not make it worse. Play the sound, listen carefully to it, act now and do it again. The first step can be clicking on the links provided to help out or know more about an enviromental organization.
